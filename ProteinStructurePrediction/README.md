Proteins are chains of amino acids that fold into 3D structures, which determine their function. Predicting how a protein folds is crucial in fields like drug discovery and synthetic biology.

Primary Structure – Amino acid sequence
Secondary Structure – Alpha-helices & beta-sheets
Tertiary Structure – 3D conformation
Quaternary Structure – Interaction of multiple protein subunits
